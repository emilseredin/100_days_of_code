# The higher or lower game
# Mechanics:
# In the first turn, 2 random elements are chosen from the data list
# Elements are presented to the user
# User has to guess which element has more of something
# In current case, elements are Instagram accounts
# And the accounts are compared based on the number of followers
# If the player guesses correctly, he gains a point, otherwise he loses
# Each following turn, 1 element is randomy picked from the list
