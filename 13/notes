Debugging tips:
---------------

- Describe the problem:
    What is actually happening?
    What should have happened instead?
    What assumptions did you make?
    Test your assumptions to see, which of them are false

- Reproduce the bug
    When does it happen?
    When does it not happen?
    Check the error message
    If an error occurs randomly, try to make the code always produce the error

- Play Computer (pretend to be Computer, i.e. read line by line)

- Fix the Errors
    Check the line of code where the error occurred
    Check data types

Syntax errors vs Semantics errors
Semantic errors occure, when your code doesn't do what you want.
Mainly, because you write wrong algorithm which is supposed to solve your problem.
The steps which have to be taken by the computer should be described as precisely as possible.

- Print is your friend
- Use a debugger
- Take a break
- Ask a friend
    People make different assumptions
- Run often
- Ask StackOverflow

The more bugs you solve, the easier will it be to solve bugs un the future
